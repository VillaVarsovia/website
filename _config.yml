title: Villa Varsovia - Esterillos, Costa Rica
email: your-email@domain.com
description: "Villa Varsovia is a modern interpretation of a traditional open-air Spanish villa with a very private interior courtyard that includes a 16'x32' pool and rancho. Polish owners, Margaret and Andrew Wieladek, who permanently reside in Canada, built the villa in 2012. Standing alone on a breezy hill, it is a secluded oasis surrounded by lush jungle. Banana and mango trees grow in the garden; playful monkeys are regular visitors; curious iguanas live on the grounds; and scarlet macaws fly above in pairs, squawking like an old married couple. The villa is on the central Pacific coast and within walking distance of the endless beach of Esterillos. Off the beaten path, it is located between the bustling town of Jaco and world famous Manuel Antonio National Park."
